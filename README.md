Convenience Makefile for building static sites based off of HTML 5 Boilerplate with Node.JS &amp; JAM

To use, just drop this in your site's project folder and run 'make' from the command line. It creates a vanilla site in a dir named website. 

TODO: Explore another JS package manager, possibly Bower or Volo.
