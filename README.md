Convenience Makefile for building static sites based off of HTML 5 Boilerplate with Node.JS &amp; Bower

To use, just drop this in your site's project folder and run 'make' from the command line. It creates a vanilla site in a subfolder named website.

Note: The Makefile also has watchers for Less & CoffeeScript
